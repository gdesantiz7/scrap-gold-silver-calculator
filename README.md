# Gold and Silver Calculator
Many people find difficulty in determining the price of their scrap gold or silver.  This can lead to great uncertainty when trying to sell.  The primary goal of this application is to allow users to get a fair value for their gold or silver so that they can properly examine offers.

This calculator outputs a value of United States Dollars (USD) given a weight and purity of gold or silver.  It does not factor in intrinsic value that may apply to rare collectibles and coins or branded jewelry.  The value of the gold or silver is determined by using the current spot price of gold or silver per ounce in the market.  For the most accurate results, please update the spot price for the desired precious metal prior to running the calculator.
